    <h1>🏏 About CricketBook</h1>
    
    <p>CricketBook is a <strong>free, real-time cricket scoring application</strong> designed for local cricket matches, tournaments, and friendly games. Our tool makes it easy to score matches ball-by-ball and share live updates instantly with players, friends, and family.</p>

    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>CricketBook provides four main ways to experience cricket matches:</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:#3b82f6;font-size:18px;margin:16px 0 8px;">⚙️ Scorer Tool</h3>
    <p>A powerful scoring interface for match officials and scorers. Record every ball, wicket, extra, and milestone with precision. Features protected edit access with secure tokens - only authorized scorers can edit matches while the public can watch safely. Create tournaments, generate organization IDs, and share dual links: public viewer links for spectators and private scorer links for co-scorers. The scorer creates unique match IDs that can be shared for live viewing, making it easy for others to follow along in real-time without the risk of accidental changes.</p>

    <h2>Perfect For</h2>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>Local neighborhood cricket matches</li>
      <li>School and college tournaments</li>
      <li>Office cricket leagues</li>
      <li>Family cricket gatherings</li>

      <li>Community cricket events</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p><strong>For Scorers:</strong> Open the scorer tool, optionally enter a tournament name (or leave blank for casual matches), enter team names and match settings, then start recording each ball. The app generates a unique Organization ID based on your tournament name to keep your matches organized. Share individual match links or the entire tournament link with spectators for live updates.</p>
    <p><strong>Tournament Management:</strong> When you enter a tournament name, it's saved to your device's history for quick autocomplete next time. Your tournament list is private and stored locally - other users won't see your tournaments in their dropdown.</p>
    <p><strong>For Viewers:</strong> Simply open the Live Score page - it automatically detects and displays the current live match. Or use the shared link (with org and match parameters) to watch a specific match across any device or browser.</p>
    <p><strong>For Everyone:</strong> Browse all matches on the Matches page, see which games are live with tournament badges (#TournamentName), and review completed match results with detailed statistics.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Built with modern web technologies including Firebase Realtime Database for instant synchronization and localStorage for privacy-focused tournament history. The app features real-time listeners that automatically update scores without page refreshes, organization-based database isolation for multi-user environments, smart match detection algorithms, tournament-based URL sharing with org and match parameters, and a responsive design that works beautifully on all screen sizes.</p>

    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>Your privacy and data integrity matter. Tournament names you create are stored only on your device using localStorage - they're never shared with other users. Each tournament gets a unique Organization ID that keeps your matches separate from others. Match scores are shared via Firebase for live viewing, but your personal tournament list remains private.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Edit Token Protection:</strong> Every match generates a secure edit token that controls who can modify scores. Share the public viewer link for spectators to watch safely (read-only mode), and share the private scorer link only with trusted co-scorers who need edit access. This prevents accidental changes and malicious tampering while keeping matches publicly viewable.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To make professional-grade cricket scoring accessible to everyone. We believe every cricket match deserves proper scoring and the ability to share the excitement with others, whether it's a neighborhood game or an organized tournament. We prioritize privacy, ease of use, and real-time collaboration while ensuring multiple users can run their own tournaments without interference.</p>
